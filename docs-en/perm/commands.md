# Command List

KaMenu provides a concise command structure. The main command is `/km` (aliases: `/kamenu`, `/menu`).

---

## Main Command

```
/km <subcommand> [arguments]
```

**Aliases:** `/kamenu`, `/menu`

---

## Subcommand Details

### /km help

Displays help information for all commands.

**Format:** `/km help`

**Permission:** None (available to all players)

**Example:**

```bash
/km help
```

**Output includes:**
- Plugin version information
- List of all available subcommands
- Brief description of each command

{% hint style="info" %}
Typing `/km` without any arguments also displays the help information.
{% endhint %}

---

### /km open

Opens a specified menu.

**Format:**
- `/km open <menu-id>` — Opens a menu for yourself (players only)
- `/km open <menu-id> <player>` — Opens a menu for a specified player (console-compatible)

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Tab completion:** After typing `/km open `, press Tab to auto-complete all loaded menu IDs (including subfolder paths).

**Examples:**

```bash
# Player opens a menu for themselves
/km open main_menu

# Player opens a menu for another player
/km open shop/weapons Player1

# Console opens a menu for a specified player (player name required)
/km open example/actions_demo Player1

# Open a menu in a subfolder
/km open shop/weapons
```

**Notes:**
- If the menu ID does not exist, the player receives an error message
- Players can omit the second argument to open the menu for themselves by default
- The console must specify the second argument (player name)
- If the specified player does not exist, an error message is displayed

{% hint style="warning" %}
Because this command can open any menu, it requires the `kamenu.admin` permission. It is recommended to use [Custom Commands](../config/customCommands.md) to provide players with a safer way to access menus.
{% endhint %}

### /km list

View all loaded menus on the server.

**Format:** `/km list [page]`

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Features:**
- Displays all loaded menus (10 per page)
- Click a menu name to open it directly
- Supports pagination
- Uses clickable text for convenient interaction

**Examples:**

```bash
# View the first page of the menu list
/km list

# View a specific page
/km list 2
```

**Display output:**

```

§6§lMenu List
§f1. example/main_menu §e[Click to open]
§f2. example/shop_menu §e[Click to open]
§f3. example/vip_menu §e[Click to open]
...
§7[Previous]  §7Page 1/3  §e[Next]

```

---

### /km guide

Opens the built-in getting started guide menu.

**Format:** `/km guide`

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Notes:**
- The guide menu is loaded from inside the plugin jar into memory and is not written to the `menus` directory
- Servers with Dialog support open the Dialog guide; older platforms without Dialog support automatically open the container guide
- It helps with first-time language setup, example release, and example menu descriptions
- When no menus are loaded and an OP player joins the server, KaMenu sends a clickable prompt to open this guide

**Examples:**

```bash
/km guide
/kamenu guide
```

---

### /km language

Sets the plugin language and immediately reloads configuration and menus. The language ID is the `.yml` filename under `plugins/KaMenu/lang/`, without the extension.

**Format:** `/km language <language_id>`

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Alias:** `/km lang <language_id>`

**Examples:**

```bash
# Switch to Simplified Chinese
/km language zh_CN

# Switch to English
/km language en_US
```

---

### /km examples

Releases built-in sample menus for the selected language to `plugins/KaMenu/menus/example/`.

**Format:** `/km examples [zh_CN|en_US] [overwrite]`

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Aliases:** `/km example`, `/km release-examples`

**Notes:**
- If no language is specified, KaMenu uses the current `language` in `config.yml`
- Both Chinese and English examples are released to `menus/example/`; no runtime `exampleEN` directory is created
- Older platforms without Dialog support release only four Container examples: `container_main`, `container_actions`, `container_furnace`, and `container_anvil`
- Platforms with Dialog support release those Container examples plus all Dialog examples
- Changing platforms does not delete files that already exist under `menus/example/`
- Existing files are skipped by default
- Add `overwrite` to replace existing sample menus with the same names
- Menus are automatically reloaded after release

**Examples:**

```bash
# Release examples using the current language
/km examples

# Release Chinese examples
/km examples zh_CN

# Release English examples
/km examples en_US

# Overwrite Chinese examples
/km examples zh_CN overwrite
```

---

### /km migrate dm

Converts DeluxeMenus chest menus into KaMenu V2 Container menus. The converter does not load DeluxeMenus or execute source actions; review third-party item, economy, and command integrations on a test server after generation.

**Format:** `/km migrate dm [source-file-or-directory] [output-directory] [overwrite]`

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Notes:**
- When the source is omitted, KaMenu scans `plugins/DeluxeMenus/gui_menus` by default
- The source may be one `.yml` file or a directory containing YAML files
- The output directory is relative to `plugins/KaMenu/menus/`; the default is `dm_migrated`
- Existing files and same-name custom commands are preserved by default; use `overwrite` to replace both
- `open_command` is converted into `custom_commands.yml > custom-commands`; every command in a DM list is mapped to the migrated menu ID
- Existing same-name custom commands are preserved and reported as conflicts by default, avoiding accidental replacement of menu or action commands
- KaMenu reloads menus, custom commands, and online players' client command trees after migration
- The command reports per-file success and WARNING/ERROR entries with source YAML paths

**Examples:**

```bash
/km migrate dm
/km migrate dm overwrite
/km migrate dm /path/to/DeluxeMenus/gui_menus
/km migrate dm /path/to/DeluxeMenus/gui_menus overwrite
/km migrate dm /path/to/DeluxeMenus/gui_menus dm_migrated overwrite
/km open dm_migrated/requirements_menu
```

See [Menu Migration Overview](../container/migration.md#deluxemenus-migration-tutorial) for the complete workflow, incompatibilities, and report format. See [Container Buttons](../container/buttons.md#variants) for same-slot `priority` merging and state variant rules.

---

### /km migrate trmenu

Compiles classic TrMenu stable-v3 inventory menus into standard KaMenu V2 Container menus. The migrator only reads source YAML. It does not load TrMenu or execute Kether, JavaScript, commands, or click actions.

**Format:** `/km migrate trmenu [source-file-or-directory] [output-directory] [overwrite]`

**Alias:** `/km migrate trm`

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Notes:**
- When the source is omitted, KaMenu scans `plugins/TrMenu/menus`
- The output directory is relative to `plugins/KaMenu/menus/`; the default is `trmenu_migrated`
- Existing menus, same-name custom commands, and item bindings are preserved unless `overwrite` is supplied
- Plain `Bindings.Commands` entries are merged into `custom_commands.yml`; regex bindings are not converted automatically
- Compatible `Bindings.Items` entries are merged into `item_bindings.yml`; unsafe item traits are skipped with diagnostics
- The migrator builds the complete batch menu-ID map before converting cross-file `open:` actions
- Every generated file is parsed again by KaMenu's Container parser; a file with any ERROR is not written
- Menus, custom commands, item bindings, and online players' client command trees are reloaded after migration

**Examples:**

```bash
/km migrate trmenu
/km migrate trm overwrite
/km migrate trmenu /path/to/TrMenu/menus trmenu_migrated overwrite
/km open trmenu_migrated/example
```

See [Menu Migration Overview](../container/migration.md#trmenu-migration) for supported features, rejection rules, and `TRM_*` diagnostic codes.

---

### /km pause

Generates or removes the ESC pause screen entry datapack. `register` reads `pause_menu.yml` from the plugin root and compiles its static KaMenu-style layout into a vanilla Dialog.

This command is available only on Paper/Folia and forks exposing the compatible Paper custom-click API. Spigot returns an unsupported-platform message.

**Format:**
- `/km pause register` — Generate the entry datapack from `plugins/KaMenu/pause_menu.yml`
- `/km pause unregister` — Remove the datapack generated by KaMenu
- `/km pause info` — Show current entry status and datapack path

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Examples:**

```bash
/km pause register
/km pause info
/km pause unregister
```

**Notes:**
- The datapack is written to `world/datapacks/KaMenuPauseEntry`
- KaMenu releases the default `pause_menu.yml` during startup when the file is missing and never overwrites an existing file
- Adding, changing, or removing it requires a full server restart before the ESC pause screen changes
- KaMenu registers one ESC entry; configure its internal button matrix under `Bottom.buttons`
- `Body.message` supports Legacy, MiniMessage, and static `<text=...>` clickable text
- Static `Inputs` are supported; buttons with `actions` receive client input through `$(key)`
- Titles, Body, input labels, and button text do not resolve runtime values; button `actions` may use PAPI, KaMenu variables, conditions, JavaScript, and action packages
- A target opened through `menu` is still parsed as a complete regular KaMenu menu
- See [ESC Pause Menu](../config/pause-menu.md) for the full syntax

---

### /km reload

Reloads plugin configuration, menus, or package folders without restarting the server. If no target is provided, KaMenu reloads everything.

**Format:** `/km reload [all|menu|actions|js|lang|config]`

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Targets:**

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `all` | Reload all modules. Same as omitting the target |
| `menu` | Reload only menu files under `menus/` |
| `actions` | Reload only global action packages under `plugins/KaMenu/actions/` |
| `js` | Reload only global JavaScript packages under `plugins/KaMenu/js/` |
| `lang` | Reload only the current language file |
| `config` | Reload `config.yml`, `custom_commands.yml`, language files, and custom commands |

Each target returns its own statistics: total, success, failed, and elapsed ms. For `config`, the counted items are custom commands under `custom-commands`. When no target is provided, or when `all` is used, KaMenu prints each module's reload result in sequence.

**Example:**

```bash
/km reload
/km reload menu
/km reload actions
/km reload js
/km reload lang
/km reload config
```

{% hint style="info" %}
After modifying menu files only, prefer `/km reload menu`. Use `/km reload` when all modules should be reloaded.
{% endhint %}

---

### /km item

Manage saved items, including saving held items, giving saved items, and deleting saved items.

**Format:**
- `/km item save <item-name>` — Save the held item to the database (players only)
- `/km item give <item-name>` — Give yourself 1 item (players only)
- `/km item give <item-name> <amount>` — Give yourself a specified number of items (players only)
- `/km item give <item-name> <player>` — Give 1 item to a specified player (console-compatible)
- `/km item give <item-name> <player> <amount>` — Give a specified number of items to a specified player (console-compatible)
- `/km item delete <item-name>` — Delete a saved item

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Details:**
- Items are serialized in Base64 format and stored in the database
- Supports all item types (including items with NBT tags)
- Can save complex items such as enchanted items and items with custom textures
- When saving, the item count is automatically set to 1 to avoid storing quantity information
- When giving items, you can specify a quantity (range: 1–64)
- Deleting an item permanently removes it from the database

**Examples:**

```bash
# Save the held item
/km item save diamond_sword
/km item save vip_reward

# Give yourself 1 item
/km item give diamond_sword

# Give yourself 10 items
/km item give diamond_sword 10

# Give 1 item to a specified player
/km item give vip_reward Player1

# Give 10 items to a specified player
/km item give vip_reward Player1 10

# Console gives 1 item to a specified player (player name required)
/km item give diamond_sword Player1

# Console gives multiple items to a specified player
/km item give diamond_sword Player1 5

# Delete a saved item
/km item delete diamond_sword
/km item delete vip_reward
```

**Tab completion:**
- After `/km item `, Tab shows subcommands (save, give, delete)
- After `/km item give `, Tab shows all saved item names
- After `/km item delete `, Tab shows all saved item names
- After an item name, Tab shows all online players (give command only)

{% hint style="warning" %}
- The `save` command can only be used by players; the console cannot use it
- In the `give` command, the player argument is optional for players (defaults to self) but required for the console
- The amount argument is optional and defaults to 1 (range: 1–64)
- Cannot save if no item is held
- If the player's inventory is full, excess items cannot be given
{% endhint %}

---

### /km action

Test and execute a specified action for debugging and verifying action configurations.

**Format:** `/km action <player> <action>`

**Permission:** `kamenu.admin`

**Notes:** This command can be used by both players and the console; a target player must always be specified.

**Supported action types:**
- Supports all server-executed action prefixes, such as `tell:`, `actionbar:`, `title:`, `hovertext:`, `command:`, `chat:`, `console:`, `sound:`, `open:`, `force-open:`, `close`, `force-close`, `reset`, `server:`, `tppos:`, `data:`, `gdata:`, `list:`, `glist:`, `meta:`, `toast:`, `money:`, `stock-item:`, `item:`, `js:`, and more.
- Action-chain or menu-context actions such as `wait`, `return`, `run-task:`, `stop-task:`, `stop-current-task`, `page:`, and `actions:` can be entered, but some effects depend on the current menu config or task lifecycle.
- `url:` and `copy:` are Paper Dialog static button click events. They only work as a single menu button action and are not useful `/km action` test targets.

For a full list of action types, see [Actions](../modern-dialog/actions.md).

---

**Examples:**

```bash
# Send a message
/km action Player1 tell:Hello World

# Play a sound
/km action Player2 sound:block_note_block_harp;volume=1.0;pitch=1.0

# Send a title
/km action Player3 title:title=Test;subtitle=Subtitle

# Operate data
/km action Player4 data:type=set;key=test;var=100

# Supports variables and PAPI
/km action Player5 tell: Your level is %player_level%, score is {data:score}
```

**Tab completion:**
- After `/km action `, Tab shows all online players
- After a player name, Tab shows supported server action prefixes

{% hint style="info" %}
This command supports all built-in variables (`{data:var}`, `{gdata:var}`, `{meta:var}`) and PlaceholderAPI variables (`%player_name%`, etc.).
{% endhint %}

## Custom Quick Commands

In addition to `/km open`, you can register custom quick commands in the plugin root file `custom_commands.yml` that map a short command directly to opening a specific menu:

```yaml
custom-commands:
  shop: 'server_shop'   # Players run /shop to open server_shop
  menu: 'main_menu'     # Players run /menu to open main_menu
```

For detailed configuration, see [Custom Commands](../config/customCommands.md).
