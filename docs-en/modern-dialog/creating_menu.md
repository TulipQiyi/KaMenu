# Creating a Menu Tutorial

This tutorial walks you through creating a complete menu from scratch, helping you quickly master KaMenu's menu-building workflow.

---

## Learning Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- ✅ Create the basic structure of a menu file
- ✅ Configure the menu title and settings
- ✅ Add text content
- ✅ Add item displays
- ✅ Add input components
- ✅ Configure buttons and actions
- ✅ Use condition checks

---

## Step 1: Create the Menu File

### 1.1 File Location

Create a new file under `plugins/KaMenu/menus/` with a meaningful name:

```
plugins/KaMenu/menus/
└── my_first_menu.yml    # Create this file
```

### 1.2 Basic Structure

To create a menu, you first need to understand its structure. A complete menu file typically contains four sections — `Title`, `Body`, `Inputs`, and `Bottom` — to display content. In addition, `Settings` and `Events` are available to extend the menu's functionality.

#### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Description | Required | Documentation |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| `Title` | Title text displayed at the very top of the menu | ✅ | [Menu Title (Title)](title.md) |
| `Body` | Area for displaying information | | [Body Components (Body)](body.md) |
| `Inputs` | Area for creating input components | | [Input Components (Inputs)](inputs.md) |
| `Bottom` | Bottom button area | ✅ | [Bottom Buttons (Bottom)](bottom.md) |
| `Settings` | Options for configuring the menu | | [Global Settings (Settings)](setting.md) |
| `Events` | Menu open/close actions | | [Events (Events)](events.md) |


{% hint style="info" %}
Did you know?
Actually all sections are optional. You can create an empty file and KaMenu will still be able to open it — but that would serve no purpose.
{% endhint %}

Creating my first menu:
```yaml
# Menu title
Title: '&6My First Menu'

# Optional: global settings
Settings:
  can_escape: true
  after_action: CLOSE

# Optional: actions executed when the menu opens
Events:
  Open:
    - 'tell: &aWelcome to the menu!'

# Optional: content display area
Body:
  ...

# Optional: input component area
Inputs:
  ...

# Bottom button area
Bottom:
  ...
```

**Current state:** You now have a basic empty menu framework!

---

## Step 2: Add Text Content

### 2.1 Add a Welcome Message

Add a text component inside the `Body` node:

```yaml
Title: '&6My First Menu'

Body:
  welcome:
    type: 'message'
    text:
      - '&7Welcome to the server shop'
      - '&7Click the button below to browse items'
```

### 2.2 Add a Separator and Tips

```yaml
Body:
  welcome:
    type: 'message'
    text:
      - '&7Welcome to the server shop'
      - '&7Click the button below to browse items'

  separator:
    type: 'message'
    text: '&8————————————————'

  tips:
    type: 'message'
    text:
      - '&eTips:'
      - '&7- Make sure you have enough balance before purchasing'
      - '&7- Contact an admin if you have any issues'
```

**Current state:** Your menu now displays a welcome message and some helpful tips.

---

## Step 3: Add Item Displays

### 3.1 Add a Single Item

```yaml
Body:
  # ... previous text content ...

  diamond_item:
    type: 'item'
    material: 'DIAMOND'
    name: '&6&lDiamond'
    lore:
      - '&7A precious gemstone'
    description: '&fClick the button below to obtain'
```

### 3.2 Add Multiple Items

```yaml
Body:
  # ... previous text content ...

  diamond_item:
    type: 'item'
    material: 'DIAMOND'
    name: '&6&lDiamond'
    lore:
      - '&7A precious gemstone'
    description: '&fClick the button below to obtain'

  iron_ingot:
    type: 'item'
    material: 'IRON_INGOT'
    name: '&f&lIron Ingot'
    lore:
      - '&7A common metal'
    description: '&fClick the button below to obtain'

  gold_ingot:
    type: 'item'
    material: 'GOLD_INGOT'
    name: '&e&lGold Ingot'
    lore:
      - '&7A rare metal'
    description: '&fClick the button below to obtain'
```

**Tip:** The material name supports multiple formats, such as `diamond_sword`, `Diamond-Sword`, `diamond sword`, etc.

**Current state:** Your menu now shows three items, each with a name and description.

---

## Step 4: Add Input Components

### 4.1 Add a Quantity Slider

```yaml
Inputs:
  diamond_amount: 
    type: 'slider'
    text: '&aSelect the number of diamonds to receive'
    min: 1
    max: 64
    default: 1
```

### 4.2 Add More Input Components

```yaml
Inputs:
  diamond_amount:
    type: 'slider'
    text: '&aSelect the number of diamonds to receive'
    min: 1
    max: 64
    default: 1

  note:
    type: 'input'
    text: '&7Note'
    default: ''
    placeholder: 'Optional...'
```
**Current state:** Players can now select a quantity and add an optional note.


Once you have created `Inputs` components, each component maps to an internal key. Using the menu above as an example: the value of the `diamond_amount` slider will be available in actions as `$(diamond_amount)`, and the value of the `note` text field will be available as `$(note)`.


---

## Step 5: Add Bottom Buttons

### 5.1 Simple Confirm Button

```yaml
Bottom:
  type: 'notice'
  confirm:
    text: '&a[ Click to Receive ]'
    actions:
      - 'item: type=give;mats=DIAMOND;amount=$(diamond_amount)' 
      - 'tell: &aSuccess! Received $(diamond_amount) item(s)'
      # Uses the built-in key $(diamond_amount), which resolves to the slider value.
      - 'sound: entity.player.levelup'
```

### 5.2 Full Button Configuration

```yaml
Bottom:
  type: 'notice'
  confirm:
    text: '&a[ Click to Receive ]'
    actions:
      - 'item: type=give;mats=DIAMOND;amount=$(diamond_amount)'
      - 'tell: &aSuccess! Received $(diamond_amount) item(s)'
      # Uses the built-in key $(diamond_amount), which resolves to the slider value.
      - 'tell: &aYour note: $(note)'
      # Uses the built-in key $(note), which resolves to the text field value.
      - 'sound: entity.player.levelup'
  cancel:
    text: '&c[ Cancel ]'
    actions:
      - 'tell: &7Purchase cancelled'
      - 'close'
```

**Current state:** Your menu now has confirm and cancel buttons that execute the corresponding actions when clicked.

---

## Step 6: Use Condition Checks

### 6.1 Display Different Content Based on Player State
In KaMenu, most areas support condition checks to display customised content.

- Normal mode:
```yaml
Body:
  player_status:
    type: 'message'
    text: 'Hello, welcome to the server!'
```
- Using condition checks
```yaml
Body:
  player_status:
    type: 'message'
    text:
      - condition: '%player_is_op% == true' 
        allow: '&6Hello, Admin! Welcome to the server!'
        deny: '&7Hello, Player! Welcome to the server!'
```

### 6.2 Using Conditions in Actions

```yaml
Bottom:
  type: 'notice'
  confirm:
    text: '&a[ Confirm ]'
    actions:
      - condition: "%player_level% >= 10"
        allow:
          - 'tell: Your level is 10 or above. Proceeding...'
            ...
        deny:
          - 'tell: Your level is below 10. Cannot proceed...'
            ...
```

**Current state:** Your menu now responds intelligently to the player's state.
